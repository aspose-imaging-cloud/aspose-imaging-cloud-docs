## Install the SDK of your choice ##
Using an SDK (API client) is the quickest way for a developer to speed up the development. An SDK takes care of a lot of low-level details of making requests and handling responses and lets you focus on writing code specific to your particular project. Please check [Available SDKs](https://docs.aspose.cloud/imaging/available-sdks/) article to learn how to add an SDK to your project.

## Make an API request from the SDK of your choice ##
Use the **App SID** and **App key (secret key)** from the API app client you created in step one and replace in the corresponding code. Below example converts image files:

{{% alert color="primary" %}} 

The [GitHub repository](https://github.com/aspose-imaging-cloud) for Aspose.Imaging Cloud has a complete set of examples, demonstrating our API capabilities.
